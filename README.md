## Why Axiom?

The ethos of Axiom is "uncompromising and intuitive".

Axiom doesn't force you to make trade-offs that you don't want to make but instead offers:

- Enhanced features AND blazing-fast performance

- Mobile-friendly core UI AND seamless in-app access to Hacker News web

Axiom aims to make all parts of the app as intuitive as possible, especially coming from Hacker News web. Axiom offers <i> some </i> customization but customization for the sake of it is considered an anti-goal:

- Thoughtful design OVER extreme customization
